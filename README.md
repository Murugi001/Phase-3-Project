### Project Overview: Customer Churn Prediction for SyriaTel
## 1. Business Understanding

SyriaTel, like many telecom providers, operates in a highly competitive industry where retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Customer churn — when subscribers stop using the service — directly impacts revenue and long-term profitability.

The challenge is that churn doesn't usually happen randomly. It can result from dissatisfaction with service quality, pricing, customer support, or competitors' offers. If SyriaTel can predict which customers are likely to churn, it can act proactively to retain them through targeted interventions.
