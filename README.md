### Project Overview: Customer Churn Prediction for SyriaTel

## 1. Business Understanding

SyriaTel, like many telecom providers, operates in a highly competitive industry where retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Customer churn — when subscribers stop using the service — directly impacts revenue and long-term profitability.

The challenge is that churn doesn't usually happen randomly. It can result from dissatisfaction with service quality, pricing, customer support, or competitors' offers. If SyriaTel can predict which customers are likely to churn, it can act proactively to retain them through targeted interventions.

### 2. Business Goal
To reduce customer churn and increase customer lifetime value (CLTV) by identifying subscribers who are most likely to leave soon.

Specifically:

i)  Build a Predictive Model for Churn

ii) Gain Insight into Churn Drivers

iii) Provide Strategic Recommendations

## 3 Intended Audience

a. Telecom Business Executives: Need insights into churn trends, retention ROI, and how churn relates to product pricing.

b. Marketing & Customer Retention Teams: Need a list of high-risk customers for proactive targeting.

c. Customer Experience/Call Center Managers: Want to understand which service areas such customer service calls correlate with churn.
